		<p>The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the same as weight, evenbxhx xhzxg though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the  lower gravity.</p>
